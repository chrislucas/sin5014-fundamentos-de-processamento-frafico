Filtro gaussiano em opencv
src - input image; the image can have any number of channels, which are processed independently, but the depth should be CV_8U, CV_16U, CV_16S, CV_32F or CV_64F.

dst - output image of the same size and type as src.

ksize - Gaussian kernel size. ksize.width and ksize.height can differ
but they both must be positive and odd. Or, they can be zeroÃ¢Â€Â™s and then they are computed from sigma*.

sigmaX - Gaussian kernel standard deviation in X direction.

sigmaY - Gaussian kernel standard deviation in Y direction; if sigmaY is zero,
t is set to be equal to sigmaX, if both sigmas are zeros, they are computed from ksize.width and ksize.height , respectively; to fully control the result regardless of possible future modifications of all this semantics, it is recommended to specify all of ksize, sigmaX, and sigmaY.

borderType - pixel extrapolation method.
